# Genetic_Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm Using Strings In multiple languages

## General Basis
The program asks the user for a key input string for the random individuals to match.
Individuals are then created of the same length as the inputted key, but all of it's characters are random.
The individuals then go through a re-populating phase where the individuals with the highest similarity to the key are given a higher chance to pass on their values (DNA) to the next generation.
This process is repeated until an individual perfectly matching the key string is found.


## Individual
The members of the population which hold the data values that get scored to find fitness

## Population
Controls all of the individuals and can find the best and average scores/individuals

## Main
Drives the program alongside getting inputs from the console
