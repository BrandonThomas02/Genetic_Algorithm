# Genetic_Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm Using Strings In multiple languages

## General Basis
Imitates natural selection to get the best individuals based on a scoring process. 
Used in this implementation to randomly match a given key string by splicing random individuals of the population together where the higher. scoring individuals are more likely to be chosen.
The population slowly gets better over time by repeating this process many times while including a random mutation chance to reach the key value inputed by the user.

## Individual
The members of the population which hold the data values that get scored to find fitness

## Population
Controls all of the individuals and can find the best and average scores/individuals

## Main
Drives the program alongside getting inputs from the console
